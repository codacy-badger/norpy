# ROADMAP

We now want to work ahead and use norpy as soon as possible in as a replacement for the crude 
RESPY adjustments in the SMM and MLE estimation and then add the additional state variable there. We use SME and MLE wrappers to estimate the model.

## Next steps

current PR:
* set up regression tests
* establish model specification object

afterwards:
* refactor F2PY interfaces (peisenha)
* set up the rest of testing infrastructure
